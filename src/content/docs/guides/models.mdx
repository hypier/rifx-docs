## Model Selection Guide

Consider the following factors when choosing models:

### 1. Performance Requirements
- **Response Speed**: For quick responses, choose models with smaller parameters like Llama 3.2 1B
- **Accuracy**: For high accuracy requirements, consider large parameter models like Qwen2.5 72B

### 2. Cost Considerations
- **Low-cost Solutions**:
  - Llama 3.2 1B: $0.01/M input, $0.02/M output
  - Qwen2 7B: $0.054/M tokens
- **High-performance Solutions**:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - OpenAI o1 series

### 3. Special Function Requirements
- **Long Text Processing**: Choose models with larger context windows
- **Image Processing**: Use multimodal models like Llama Vision or Qwen2-VL
- **Professional Fields**: Select specially optimized models based on specific scenarios
